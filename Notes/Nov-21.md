- V8 is a fast Javascript engine
- It has about 28 key words
- Other useful javascript key words or methods such as the `map` method on arrays come from the standard library
- This standard library may be written in different langauges
- Then there is the browser, the actual runtime environment, this has the window DOM and other things that have been set up to be easy to be communicated with using JavaScript
- These things (Web APIs) in the browser can be written in another language such as C/C++
- A load of these API's that add functionality added to browsers, they are basically libraries that we can import to use 

- TODO: read the post on local storage and add a settings button to choose the language, and see if can store this in local storage
